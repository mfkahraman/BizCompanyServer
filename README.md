# 🌟 Full‑Stack Company Website (Angular + .NET API)

This project is a **practice full‑stack web application**.  
I built it to improve my skills in **Angular** on the front‑end and **ASP.NET Core Web API** on the back‑end.

The website looks like a simple company site with different pages, dynamic content, and smooth communication between the front-end and the server.  
It also includes real-world features such as image upload, validation, and clean data models.

## 📁 Repositories

### 🔹 Front-End (Angular)
**Repo:** https://github.com/mfkahraman/MyFirstAngularProject

The front-end is built with Angular using a **component-based** structure.  
All data is loaded from the .NET API through Angular services.  
The UI uses **SweetAlert2** for clean alert messages and user feedback.  
It also supports selecting an image and sending it to the server.

### 🔹 Back-End (.NET Web API)
**Repo:** https://github.com/mfkahraman/BizCompanyServer

The back-end provides REST API endpoints for all data used by the front-end.  
It uses a layered approach with controllers, services, and data access.  
- **Entity Framework Core** is used for database operations.  
- **DTOs** keep API responses clean and safe.  
- **FluentValidation** handles input validation.  
- A **CORS policy** allows safe communication with the Angular front-end.  
The API also receives images from the front-end, stores them, and returns a public URL.
